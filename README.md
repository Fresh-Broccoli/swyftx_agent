To use this application, there are a few prerequisites:

1. You need a SwyftX account, which can be created at: https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/

2. You need an API key, which you can create one by following this guide: https://help.swyftx.com.au/en/articles/3825168-how-to-create-an-api-key

3. You need Python 3 with all libraries listed in requirements.txt installed.
   This can be done by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the command prompt.
   
3.5. 'talib' is a special library that is a little more complicated to install. Follow installation instructions here: https://blog.quantinsti.com/install-ta-lib-python/


Once you have satisfied all prerequisites, copy and paste your API in a .txt file, name it 'key.txt', and place it in the same directory as bot.py and swyftx.py.

Finally, you can run bot.py, create an instantiation of Bot, and play around with it.
